By not asserting yourself.

00:02.208 --> 00:03.000 line:90% align:center
John avoided

00:03.000 --> 00:04.750 line:90% align:center
conflict in the moment,

00:04.750 --> 00:07.750 line:90% align:center
but that came with a cost.

00:08.125 --> 00:09.500 line:90% align:center
Anna dismissed his role

00:09.500 --> 00:11.375 line:90% align:center
in the Client Update.

00:11.375 --> 00:12.625 line:90% align:center
John's credibility

00:12.625 --> 00:15.291 line:90% align:center
in the meeting decreased.

00:15.291 --> 00:17.000 line:90% align:center
The team may now see him

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000 line:90% align:center
as less reliable.

00:22.250 --> 00:23.458 line:90% align:center
Passive communication

00:23.458 --> 00:24.833 line:90% align:center
often feels safer,

00:24.833 --> 00:26.250 line:90% align:center
but over time it creates

00:26.250 --> 00:27.833 line:90% align:center
frustration, missed

00:27.833 --> 00:28.708 line:90% align:center
opportunities

00:28.708 --> 00:31.708 line:90% align:center
and unbalanced relationships.

00:31.791 --> 00:33.458 line:90% align:center
How do you think Anna perceived

00:33.458 --> 00:36.000 line:90% align:center
John here as cooperative?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.041 line:90% align:center
Or as someone who

00:37.041 --> 00:38.125 line:90% align:center
can't be counted on?
