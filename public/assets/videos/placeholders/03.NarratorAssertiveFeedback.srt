1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,640
Did you

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,680
notice how John

3
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,720
handled this situation?

4
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,560
He acknowledged

5
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,880
the impact of the delay

6
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,120
without becoming defensive.

7
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,840
He then voiced his own need

8
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,880
for clearer priorities,

9
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,080
and, crucially,

10
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,640
he invited Anna to work

11
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,120
together on a solution.

12
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,000
This is assertive

13
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,880
communication and action.

14
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,120
The tone is calm,

15
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,560
the words are clear,

16
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,880
and the message respects

17
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,720
both John's

18
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,160
perspective and Anna's.

19
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,320
The result?

20
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,760
Tension decreases,

21
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,320
trust increases,

22
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,040
and the meeting

23
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,040
becomes constructive.

24
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,040
Assertiveness doesn't mean

25
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,040
being louder or pushing harder.

26
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,760
It means balancing firmness

27
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,600
with respect.

28
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,800
When you do this, you

29
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,200
not only protect your own needs,

30
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,200
you also strengthen collaboration.

31
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,360
How do you think

32
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,480
Anna perceived John

33
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,760
in this exchange

34
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,400
as a problem maker

35
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,880
or as a problem solver?
