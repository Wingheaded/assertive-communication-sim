I understand the

00:01.500 --> 00:03.416 line:90% align:center
delay has an impact.

00:03.416 --> 00:04.458 line:90% align:center

I need clear priorities.

00:06.458 --> 00:07.458 line:90% align:center
Can we align

00:07.458 --> 00:08.625 line:90% align:center
what is urgent so I

00:08.625 --> 00:09.791 line:90% align:center
can deliver on time?
