00:00.833 --> 00:02.583 line:90% align:center
Notice what happened here.

00:02.583 --> 00:05.083 line:90% align:center
John expressed himself forcefully,

00:05.083 --> 00:06.083 line:90% align:center
but the tone

00:06.083 --> 00:07.375 line:90% align:center
and delivery shifted

00:07.375 --> 00:09.625 line:90% align:center
into aggression.

00:09.625 --> 00:10.583 line:90% align:center
His raised voice

00:10.583 --> 00:11.875 line:90% align:center
and dismissive language

00:11.875 --> 00:13.958 line:90% align:center
may have felt like taking control,

00:13.958 --> 00:15.208 line:90% align:center
but in reality,

00:15.208 --> 00:16.000 line:90% align:center
this behavior

00:16.000 --> 00:17.083 line:90% align:center
risks damaging

00:17.083 --> 00:19.916 line:90% align:center
trust and relationships

00:19.916 --> 00:21.458 line:90% align:center
in communication styles.

00:21.458 --> 00:23.666 line:90% align:center
This is the aggressive mode.

00:23.666 --> 00:25.166 line:90% align:center
The focus is on winning

00:25.166 --> 00:26.625 line:90% align:center
or dominating, often

00:26.625 --> 00:29.041 line:90% align:center
at the cost of collaboration.

00:29.041 --> 00:30.250 line:90% align:center
The short term result

00:30.250 --> 00:32.625 line:90% align:center
might be attention or compliance,

00:32.625 --> 00:33.625 line:90% align:center
but the long term

00:33.625 --> 00:35.500 line:90% align:center
impact is resistance.

00:35.500 --> 00:38.416 line:90% align:center
Resentment, and isolation.

00:38.416 --> 00:39.583 line:90% align:center
Now let's pause.

00:39.583 --> 00:41.791 line:90% align:center
Imagine you are Anna receiving

00:41.791 --> 00:43.708 line:90% align:center
John's words in that tone.

00:43.708 --> 00:45.375 line:90% align:center
How would you feel?

00:45.375 --> 00:46.500 line:90% align:center
Defensive.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.625 line:90% align:center
Shut down.

00:48.625 --> 00:50.166 line:90% align:center
Aggressiveness often masks

00:50.166 --> 00:51.208 line:90% align:center
legitimate concerns

00:51.208 --> 00:52.041 line:90% align:center
that could have been voiced

00:52.041 --> 00:53.958 line:90% align:center
in a calm, assertive way,

00:53.958 --> 00:55.000 line:90% align:center
one that respects

00:55.000 --> 00:56.291 line:90% align:center
both John's needs and

00:56.291 --> 00:57.333 line:90% align:center
Anna's perspective.
