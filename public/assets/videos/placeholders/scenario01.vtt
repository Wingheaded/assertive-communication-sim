Hi Marcus,

00:01.625 --> 00:02.125 line:90% align:center
I wanted

00:02.125 --> 00:03.541 line:90% align:center
to talk about a few issues

00:03.541 --> 00:04.666 line:90% align:center
that have come up recently

00:04.666 --> 00:05.958 line:90% align:center
with our platform.

00:05.958 --> 00:07.708 line:90% align:center
Some things haven't been resolved

00:07.708 --> 00:10.166 line:90% align:center
as quickly as the team expected,

00:10.166 --> 00:11.958 line:90% align:center
and it's starting to affect

00:11.958 --> 00:13.708 line:90% align:center
how people work.

00:13.708 --> 00:14.875 line:90% align:center
I'd like to understand

00:14.875 --> 00:15.958 line:90% align:center
what's going on

00:15.958 --> 00:17.541 line:90% align:center
and how we can handle

00:17.541 --> 00:19.333 line:90% align:center
this better moving forward.
