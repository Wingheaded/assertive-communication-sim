Anna, I need to be direct.

00:01.750 --> 00:03.541 line:90% align:center
We delayed a customer response

00:03.541 --> 00:05.583 line:90% align:center
by four hours last Friday

00:05.583 --> 00:06.375 line:90% align:center
because of the new

00:06.375 --> 00:08.000 line:90% align:center
approval process.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.208 line:90% align:center
That delay triggered

00:09.208 --> 00:10.708 line:90% align:center
a formal complaint,

00:10.708 --> 00:13.708 line:90% align:center
and my team is taking the heat.

00:13.958 --> 00:14.875 line:90% align:center
I understand why

00:14.875 --> 00:16.333 line:90% align:center
the process exists,

00:16.333 --> 00:17.125 line:90% align:center
but right now

00:17.125 --> 00:19.166 line:90% align:center
it's hurting our responsiveness.

00:19.166 --> 00:20.333 line:90% align:center
This needs to change.
