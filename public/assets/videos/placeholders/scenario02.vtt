I need to be honest.

00:03.416 --> 00:04.208 line:90% align:center
I'm struggling

00:04.208 --> 00:05.458 line:90% align:center
to keep things under control

00:05.458 --> 00:06.875 line:90% align:center
right now.

00:06.875 --> 00:08.916 line:90% align:center
I'm covering several moving parts,

00:08.916 --> 00:10.708 line:90% align:center
and when updates or dependencies

00:10.708 --> 00:11.750 line:90% align:center
come in late,

00:11.750 --> 00:13.708 line:90% align:center
everything backs up on my side.

00:13.708 --> 00:14.375 line:90% align:center
At the moment,

00:14.375 --> 00:15.750 line:90% align:center
I'm spending a lot of time

00:15.750 --> 00:16.791 line:90% align:center
chasing information

00:16.791 --> 00:18.500 line:90% align:center
instead of coordinating work,

00:18.500 --> 00:20.708 line:90% align:center
and it's becoming unsustainable.

00:20.708 --> 00:22.916 line:90% align:center
I need us to be more aligned

00:22.916 --> 00:25.000 line:90% align:center
because I can't keep absorbing

00:25.000 --> 00:26.458 line:90% align:center
this level of uncertainty.
