00:00.200 --> 00:00.640 line:90% align:center
Did you

00:00.640 --> 00:01.680 line:90% align:center
notice how John

00:01.680 --> 00:03.720 line:90% align:center
handled this situation?

00:03.720 --> 00:04.560 line:90% align:center
He acknowledged

00:04.560 --> 00:05.880 line:90% align:center
the impact of the delay

00:05.880 --> 00:08.120 line:90% align:center
without becoming defensive.

00:08.120 --> 00:09.840 line:90% align:center
He then voiced his own need

00:09.840 --> 00:11.880 line:90% align:center
for clearer priorities,

00:11.880 --> 00:13.080 line:90% align:center
and, crucially,

00:13.080 --> 00:14.640 line:90% align:center
he invited Anna to work

00:14.640 --> 00:17.120 line:90% align:center
together on a solution.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.000 line:90% align:center
This is assertive

00:18.000 --> 00:19.880 line:90% align:center
communication and action.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.120 line:90% align:center
The tone is calm,

00:21.120 --> 00:22.560 line:90% align:center
the words are clear,

00:22.560 --> 00:23.880 line:90% align:center
and the message respects

00:23.880 --> 00:24.720 line:90% align:center
both John's

00:24.720 --> 00:27.160 line:90% align:center
perspective and Anna's.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.320 line:90% align:center
The result?

00:28.320 --> 00:29.760 line:90% align:center
Tension decreases,

00:29.760 --> 00:31.320 line:90% align:center
trust increases,

00:31.320 --> 00:32.040 line:90% align:center
and the meeting

00:32.040 --> 00:35.040 line:90% align:center
becomes constructive.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.040 line:90% align:center
Assertiveness doesn't mean

00:38.040 --> 00:41.040 line:90% align:center
being louder or pushing harder.

00:41.880 --> 00:43.760 line:90% align:center
It means balancing firmness

00:43.760 --> 00:45.600 line:90% align:center
with respect.

00:45.600 --> 00:46.800 line:90% align:center
When you do this, you

00:46.800 --> 00:49.200 line:90% align:center
not only protect your own needs,

00:49.200 --> 00:52.200 line:90% align:center
you also strengthen collaboration.

00:54.600 --> 00:55.360 line:90% align:center
How do you think

00:55.360 --> 00:56.480 line:90% align:center
Anna perceived John

00:56.480 --> 00:57.760 line:90% align:center
in this exchange

00:57.760 --> 00:59.400 line:90% align:center
as a problem maker

00:59.400 --> 01:00.880 line:90% align:center
or as a problem solver?
